    <h1>About me</h1>

    <div class="textItem">
        <p>My name is Fanny Nilsson, I'm 24 years old and have a bachelor’s degree in media studies from Uppsala
            University but currently studying front-end development at Hyper Island in Stockholm. During the course of
            my program, I have been introduced to web development in the form of languages such as HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript, learned how to work in agile development teams and processes as well as UX, UI, and tools for
            interface design. The front-end developer program has made me substantially more capable of taking ideas and
            concepts and making them into real web products and projects.
            <br><br>
            My previous work experiences consist mainly of customer service for several different large companies,
            including Klarna, Tradera (a Swedish equivalent to eBay) and Zalando. These experiences within customer
            service have made me learn how to talk to and encounter a lot of different types of people, as well as be
            well adaptable. Zalando is located in Berlin, and I chose to move there alone to challenge myself and
            receive new experiences, which was difficult at times, but the experiences I brought with me, the people I
            got to know, and the obstacles I overcame made me into a stronger and more independent person.
            <br><br>
            I have previously also been working with social media at one of the largest weather providers in Sweden,
            Klart.se. This experience has taught me to understand the user experience even more in the way that I had to
            produce content that would be appreciated from a customer’s point of view. It has also been very helpful in
            improving my writing skills since a major part of my responsibilities consisted of writing copy for
            Instagram and Facebook.
            <br><br>
            In addition to my current studies at Hyper Island, I am working at the analytics company Whispr Group. At
            Whispr, I get the opportunity to work with a large number of data, learn how to collect it, structure it,
            and extracting the most essential parts. It has allowed me to develop my analytical skills, learn how to
            transform data into insights as well as producing material on a short deadline.
            <br><br>
            The field within my current studies that I have found the most interesting is the UX, which centers on
            different ways of designing visual forms and readable user experiences. I have realized that it’s a
            discipline that not only allows for - but is actually contingent on - the combination of ideas and
            expressions from, among other, design, culture, psychology and technology and something I believe is highly
            interesting.
