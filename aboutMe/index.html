        <p>My name is Fanny Nilsson, I'm 26 years old and have a bachelor’s degree in media studies from Uppsala
            University as well as a diploma in frontend development from Hyper Island in Stockholm. The field within
            my latest studies that I have found the most interesting is the UX, which centers on different ways of
            designing visual forms and readable user experiences. I have realized that it’s a discipline that not only
            allows for - but is actually contingent on - the combination of ideas and expressions from, among other,
            design, culture, psychology and technology and something I believe is highly interesting.
            <br><br>
            As of right now, I am working as a UX Designer at a consulting company called Knowit Experience. As a
            consultant, I get to work with a lot of different companies in different industries which gives me a broad
            understanding of different user experiences that I can bring with me in my work and keep on designing
            great products and services from a user perspective.
            <br><br>
            In addition to my studies at Hyper Island, I was working at the analytics company Whispr Group. At
            Whispr, I get the opportunity to work with a large number of data, learn how to collect it, structure it,
            and extracting the most essential parts. It has allowed me to develop my analytical skills, learn how to
            transform data into insights as well as producing material on a short deadline.
            <br><br>
            I have previously also been working with social media at one of the largest weather providers in Sweden,
            Klart.se. This experience has taught me to understand the user experience even more in the way that I had to
            produce content that would be appreciated from a customer’s point of view. It has also been very helpful in
            improving my writing skills since a major part of my responsibilities consisted of writing copy for
            Instagram and Facebook.
            <br><br>
            Other previous work experiences consist mainly of customer service for several different large companies,
            including Klarna, Tradera (a Swedish equivalent to eBay) and Zalando. These experiences within customer
            service have made me learn how to talk to and encounter a lot of different types of people, as well as be
            well adaptable. Zalando is located in Berlin, and I chose to move there alone to challenge myself and
            receive new experiences, which was difficult at times, but the experiences I brought with me, the people I
            got to know, and the obstacles I overcame made me into a stronger and more independent person.
